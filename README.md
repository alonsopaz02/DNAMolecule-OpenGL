# DNAMolecule-OpenGL
Graphic application that draws a DNA molecule in two different ways using transformations, GLUT primitives, menus and keyboard funcionalities.

# How to compile
1. Open CodeBlocks 17.12
2. Create a New Project, select "GLUT Project"
3. When they ask you for the location of GLUT library, search for the directory where you have the folder of GLUT library
4. The library used was upload in this repository by the name of "GLUT.rar"
5. You can copy all the main.cpp code in the main file of the project you just created
6. Compile & Run

   *Another way*
   Open a new project in CodeBlocks 17.12 and select all the project files in this repository and hit run.

# Features
1. Developed in Spanish
2. A cilinder that revolves around the molecule can be activaded using menues
3. Menues are displayed using right click
4. Can choose to draw the 3D axis
5. Can choose between two modes of drawing, a solid model or an alambric model.
*Alambric model uses OpenGL basic primitives, while the solid model uses a own designed function to draw a cilinder*
6. Rotation can be activated in the menu and it begins when "R" in mayus is pressed
7. "I" moves camara forward
8. "M" moves camara backwards
9. "K", "L" and "P" are for camera rotationes
10. "Z" and "X" is for increasing the speed of the rotations
